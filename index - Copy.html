    <h1>Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)</h1>
    <p>How a Nuclear Power Plant Generates Electricity</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction to Nuclear Power</h2>
    <p>
        A nuclear power plant generates electricity using nuclear fission rather than burning fossil fuels.
        In a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), nuclear energy is converted into thermal energy,
        then mechanical energy, and finally electrical energy.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Nuclear Fission Process</h2>
    <p>
        Uranium-235 fuel undergoes nuclear fission when struck by a slow neutron.
        The nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing heat energy,
        additional neutrons, and radiation.
        The neutrons sustain a controlled chain reaction inside the reactor core.

    <h2>Primary Coolant System</h2>
    <p>
        High-pressure water circulates through the reactor core to absorb heat.
        The water is maintained at approximately 150 atmospheres,
        preventing it from boiling even above 300°C.
        This radioactive water flows through thick pipes to the steam generator.

    <h2>Steam Generator (Heat Exchanger)</h2>
    <p>
        The steam generator transfers heat from the radioactive primary loop
        to a separate non-radioactive secondary loop.
        Thousands of metal tubes allow heat transfer by conduction,
        while preventing the two water systems from mixing.
        The secondary water turns into steam, which drives the turbine.

    <h2>Steam Turbine and Generator</h2>
    <p>
        High-pressure steam expands through the turbine,
        converting thermal energy into mechanical rotational energy.
        The turbine shaft spins an electric generator,
        which produces alternating current through electromagnetic induction.

<section>
    <h2>Condenser and Cooling System</h2>
    <p>
        After passing through the turbine, steam enters the condenser,
        where cooling water removes excess heat and converts it back into liquid.
        A third independent cooling loop transfers heat to the cooling tower,
        which releases water vapor into the atmosphere.

<section>
    <h2>Safety Systems</h2>
    <p>
        The reactor is enclosed in a reinforced containment structure.
        Control rods regulate the chain reaction,
        and emergency cooling systems ensure reactor stability.
        The separation of three water loops ensures radioactive materials remain contained.
